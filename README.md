### ‚öô **I'm currently doing...**
Trying to get a degree (Informatics Engineering)

 Last Semester

 Current Subjects :

On top of that :

I've got a project, it's about Distributed File Systems. More updates on that later.

### ‚ú® **My favorite repository...**
A variation of the "Conway's Game of Life", made with Pedro Decolin's collaboration and Andr√© Bortoli's help.

I am very proud of it (mostly the file system), and I really enjoy working with the C language.

It was a project for the Operating Systems subject at IPB, proposed by the professor Arnaldo Pereira.
